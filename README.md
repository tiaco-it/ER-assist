## Workflow
#### Create branch
First off, create a new branch:
```bash
git pull
git checkout -b <branch-name> master
```
> Branch-name should be with the convention iss(issue-id-number)

Next, write your code, stage the files and commit:
```bash
git status
git add <some-file>
git commit -m "commit message"
```
Iterate the above for changes you make.

Before you end a session, push your work to git:
```bash
git push origin <branch-name> 
```
> Use _git push **-u** origin \<branch-name\>_ to set upstream to your branch. i.e. next time use just _git push_

#### Close branch

When you are ready to merge your branch to the master you should issue a Pullrequest on Github to let others review your code. You can manage the merge from Github, and delete the branch locally when you are done. 

If, however, Github can't automatically merge follow these steps:

When you are done with the branch.
First merge the master into your branch to check for mergconflicts:
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout <branch-name>
git merge master
```
Fix any mergeconflicts, switch to master and merge it with your branch:
```bash
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff <branch-name>
```
Push master to git:
```bash
git push origin master
```
Delete your branch:
```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

ALL DONE!
